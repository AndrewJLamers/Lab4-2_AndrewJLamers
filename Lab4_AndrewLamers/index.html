                        <p>  At first, it was just a joke between myself and a classmate at the University of Minnesota.  It didn't take long for me to realize that it was more than a joke, it was how I wanted to approach my career.<br><br></p>
                        <p> That may sound like a lofty goal, but I believe everything starts with a small change that we can build upon.</p><br>
                        <p>Whether that is making someone's life easier, developing a more efficient work flow, or taking on a new challenge, our goal here at Minnesconsin Mapping is to take on positive change with relentless forward progress.<br><br> - Andrew Lamers</p><br><br>

				        <p>My experience with coding and writing script had been tumultuous at best. <br>
                            It has only been since I started my online Master of Science Program with UW-Madison that I started to feel comfortable within that dynamic.<br> During my first semester we were exposed to CartoCSS, CSS, Python, and HTML (which was used to develop this webpage).<br>It is because of this swing in experience and opinion that my first Project Spotlight feature is my 90's RPG interactive world map.<br>Developed using Mapbox Studio and CartoCSS, this project opened my eyes to the extent scripting can be used as a tool for design.</p><br><br>
